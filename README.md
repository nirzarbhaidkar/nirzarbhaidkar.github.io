About Me
As a digital marketer, I specialize in building and implementing strategies focused on Google and Facebook Ads, primarily for small to medium-sized businesses. I have successfully grown organic revenue and created an interactive web presence across various platforms for clients. I am deeply inquisitive and love uncovering patterns and discovering the meaning behind data, thrilled to prove intuition with numbers. I believe that today's marketing is as much about data as it's about creativity, and I aim to bring both these domains together.
